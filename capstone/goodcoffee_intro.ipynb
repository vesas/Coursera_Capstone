    "## Introduction\n",
    "Good coffee company Ltd has decided to expand to the Helsinki capital region. One question remains: Which neighborhood would be a good location for the new coffee shop?\n",
    "\n",
    "To provide some basis for this decision, let's analyze some data about the Helsinki capital region. We would like to see some data about the economic situation in the neighborhoods, and also would like to include some analysis of the existing offering of caf√©s in the area.\n",
    "\n",
    "Helsinki capital region is an area which contains the cities of Vantaa, Espoo and Kauniainen, in addition to the capital of Finland: Helsinki. There are approximately 1.19 million inhabitants in the Helsinki capital region.\n",
    "\n",
    "The aim of this study is to help the stakeholders of this imaginary coffee company to decide where to open a new cafe in the helsinki metropolitan region. The company does not previously have a cafe in Helsinki.\n",
    "\n",
    "This study/notebook could also be used as a starting point for any other futher analysis of Helsinki region data.\n"
